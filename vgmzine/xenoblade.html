		<h1>Music and Composition: A Chat With Yasunori Mitsuda</h1>
		<h2>By Brandon Bui</h2><br>

		<div class="caption">Veteran composer and producer, Yasunori Mitsuda</div>
		</div>

		<p>For JRPG fans, the name Yasunori Mitsuda may ring a few bells. For others, he might as well be a household name. The acclaimed music composer of <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Xenogears</em> fame, and now a memorable name for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> and its DLC prequel <em>Torna – The Golden Country</em>, was gracious enough to answer some of my questions about producing and composing music for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> and other titles, and how music has changed since he started out.</p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong>Brandon Bui: When you started out as a musician, you also found an almost-calling in golf, but later re-discovered music after inspiration from Blade Runner and The Pink Panther, with the major step being taken after Railman. What was it about Railman that convinced you that you should pursue music, full time?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>Yasunori Mitsuda: I truly love movies. Without movies, I would not be doing music work. Railman, for me truly had the best music, and it stole my heart.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong>You used to do a lot of work as you were discovering the Japanese music industry; did any of those experiences carry over and influence the kind of musician you are today?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>One thing that does happen nowadays, young musicians often say to me, “I’m a huge fan of yours”. That makes me feel very glad.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong>What are some of your biggest music influences nowadays?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>I have been heavily influenced by jazz, classical, world music, and the music in old movies.</p>

		<h5>On Xenoblade Chronicles 2</h5>



		<div class="question"><p><strong>A big point I would like to state here in your <em>Xenoblade 2</em> work is that this game is one of the very few games in which I’ve actually had to set down my controller, and just listen to the music. I deeply enjoyed the work you did.</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>Thank you very much. I’m so glad.</p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong>That being said, can you explain your musical composition process for this game? How did you come to be involved in the production of the music for this game?</strong></p></div>

		<p>Actually, I refused to participate in this game twice. I felt that, because the newcomer composer was already composing music and I felt it wasn’t necessary for me to work on the game. However, Mr. [Tetsuya] Takahashi (Editor’s Note: Executive Director of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> and head of Monolith Soft) asked me many times, so I decided to participate after all.<br></p>

		</div><br>


		<div class="question"><p><strong> Did Takahashi-san give you instructions on how you were to compose the tracks in <em>Xenoblade 2</em> or did you have major creative freedoms?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>Mr. Takahashi let me compose freely. Working with him is always a worthwhile experience.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p> What was your biggest challenge in creating the soundtrack?<br></p></div>

		<p>Among all the games that I have participated in, <em>Xenoblade 2</em>  was the biggest project so far. There was so much to do. But, to be honest, I do not want to work again in the standing position as a composer & producer.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> What piece of the <em>Xenoblade</em> soundtrack are you most proud of?</strong></p></div><br>

		</div>

		<p>My favorite song in <em>Xenoblade</em> is the opening. All stories start from there. Regarding the soundtrack as a whole, the sounds of five composers were beautifully unified into one soundtrack. If each composer worked selfishly, the product would have collapsed completely.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> One of my favorite tracks from the game was "Where We Used to Be" [played in the opening moments of the game] – seeing how the piece was applied to the various scenarios was phenomenal. How did this theme end up coming to be?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>I thought of and created a melody that was both bright and dark.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> You’ve stated that your music compositions are representational works. How has your music developed from <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> back in 2010 to, now, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> here in 2018?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>I think that maybe nothing has changed. But, I do think my music has become more delicate.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> Who was your favorite <em>Xenoblade</em> character (or species) to write the music for?</strong></p></div>

		<p>I loved writing music for Praetor Amalthus.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> Can we expect a <em>Xenoblade</em> concert series anytime soon? I’d love to attend one of those.</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>I think it would be quite difficult. I haven’t made any plans yet.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> What were the unusual/uncommon instruments that you included in the orchestra that were necessary to create the musical experience you wanted for the game? What was your favorite instrument to use?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>I didn’t use any particularly rare instruments this time. However, ANÚNA’s choir was truly amazing and had an unprecedented sound. [Editor’s note: ANÚNA is Ireland’s National Choir, founded in 1987 by Michael McGlynn, who composes and arranges the majority of the group’s works. In <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em>, ANÚNA sang several pieces that are in the overworld themes for the Indoline Praetorium’s day and night themes, as well as for the Kingdom of Tantal’s capital city of Theosoir].<br></p>

		<h5>About <em>Torna – The Golden Country</em></h5>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> The sound is a lot more acoustic! How did you come up for the theme of Torna? What was the biggest influence in that theme?</strong></p></div><br>

		<div class="caption">"Torna: the Golden Country" Story Trailer</div>

		<p>I talked with Mr. Takahashi from Monolith Soft about what kind of sound Torna would have. Torna’s theme is a human drama. So, we decided to build it with an acoustic sound. The influence stemmed from the overall scenario of Torna. [Editor’s note: <em>Torna – The Golden Country</em> is set 500 years before the main game, focusing on a major conflict outlined in the game as the Aegis War, a war which saw the sinking of three Titans.]<br><p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> Are there any instruments that you used in this update that you didn’t use in the main game?</strong></p></div><br>

		<p>The newly used instruments were the darbuka, conga and recorder.<br><p>

		<h5>With <em>Xenoblade 2</em> complete…</h5>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> What would be your dream project?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>It’s to make a new album using instruments from around the world.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> Would you do anything differently in your music if you listened to your old works again?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>Some of my old works couldn’t be expressed well due to technical problems. So, there are plenty of parts I would like to change if I can do a remake. Otherwise, I think the music at that time is perfect.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> When you see fans covering your own music, how does it feel for you?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>That makes me very happy, I want to make music that everyone can enjoy.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p> With technology and music compositions getting as advanced as it is, are there ever times where you reminisce about having the simpler sounds back? Where do you see video game music, and music in general, heading?<br></p></div><br>

		<p>I think so. But, my music is always made by subtraction.
		I think part of the concept behind music being both “Beauty and Art” is to not use useless sounds. Unfortunately, though, I don’t think there will be a grand evolution of games music in the future. I think that it can evolve further by using an acoustic sound.<br></p>

		<div class="question"><p><strong> From the <em>Chrono</em> series to the <em>Xeno</em> series, to every other body of work you’ve since created, what is your hallmark composition that will stand out to you the most as the occasion where you felt that it was your best work ever?</strong><br></p></div>

		<p>Hmmm…… This is a difficult question. All the songs I made are important. So I cannot choose just one. Sorry!</p>
