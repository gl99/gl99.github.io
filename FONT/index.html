The concept behind the typeface was to create a fragmented typeface in disarray, but still have letters clearly recognizable. It is designed as a display font, but could work as a text font if the spacing was adjusted properly. I went with a broken-up approach with misaligned components to convey the image of shattered ice/glass. Each piece of the letters are also different colors to represent different amounts of light. The sides of the triangles and their relation to one other are varied﻿﻿ to support the idea of uneven broken shards, but still have structure.
